`userdmp` is library in Rust for parsing Minidump (.dmp) files generated in user mode on Windows

## Features

- âœ… **Module List Stream (`ModuleListStream`)**: Contains information about all loaded modules (e.g., DLLs), including their file paths, base addresses, and sizes.  
- âœ… **Handle Data Stream (`HandleDataStream`)**: Captures details about open handles in the process, such as references to files, threads, and synchronization objects.  
- âœ… **System Info Stream (`SystemInfoStream`)**: Includes metadata about the operating system (e.g., version, build number) and hardware (e.g., CPU type and number of processors).  
- âœ… **Exception Stream (`ExceptionStream`)**: Records details about the exception that triggered the dump, including the exception code, address, and relevant parameters.  
- âœ… **Memory Stream (`MemoryListStream / MemoryInfoListStream`)**: Provides a list of memory regions that were included in the dump, allowing analysis of process memory contents at the time of the crash.

## Getting started

Add `userdmp` to your project by updating your `Cargo.toml`:
```bash
cargo add userdmp
```

## Usage

The userdmp library provides tools to parse and analyze Minidump (.dmp) files generated in user mode on Windows. Here's how you can use it:

### Parsing a Minidump File

To start working with a Minidump file, use the `UserDump::new` function to parse the file and create a `UserDump` instance:
```rust, ignore
use userdmp::{UserDump, UserDmpError};

fn main() -> Result<(), UserDmpError> {
    // Parse the Minidump file
    let dump = UserDump::new("example.dmp")?;
    println!("Minidump parsed successfully!");

    Ok(())
}
```
